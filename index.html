 <hr>
    <p>I am an Engineer, programmer, tinkerer and car guy.</p>
    <h3>BIO</h3>
    <p>I have a BSc in Electical Engineering from the University of Alberta. I have spent 20+ years in the wireless 
        business designing systems ranging from Microwave links to Cellular networks. I have worked for Sprint, Cricket 
        and am now part of the T-Mobile family where I spend my days doing Machine Learning systems support. I have been
        sticking things in and pulling things out of databases for at least the last 15 years. (MSSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Netezza, DB2 to name a few).
        I fell in love with python ~8 years ago and have spent countless hours honing my pythonista skills. I have been on my own as a consultant. 
        When I am not coding away - you can find me spending time with my lovely wife, tinkering with electronics or wrenching on my cars.
